beck\nsubject : project hurricane / bridgeline status\nhere is a quick status and list of to do ' s related to setting up the new j . v .\nbetween enron & texaco which will be combining the lrc and bridgeline\npipeline systems :\nsummary : the lrc & bridgeline pipeline systems will be combined under the\nname of bridgeline llc . ownership in the jv will be split 60 % texaco & 40 %\nenron . bridgeline gas marketing llc will be the entity that will be trading\non the pipelines under the new j . v . contracts and service agreements are in\nthe process of being drafted .\nenron will be providing the trading and commercial operations systems to\nsupport this j . v . texaco will be providing the scada system . i understand\nthat accounting is still being discussed . the trading , risk , & perhaps\nscheduling personnel for this jv will be initially relocated to the 21 st\nfloor of the enron building and will eventually move to probably the 3 allen\ncenter once a more permanent spot can be built out . trading for the new jv\nwill start in early february for march production .\nto do ' s :\naccounting : i ' ve asked jim coffey to set up two work orders to capture it\ntransition and ongoing costs . texaco is also trying to set up a meeting next\nmonday to step through the accounting flow so that we are all on the same\npage and make sure there is nothing that will fall through the cracks .\npc ' s : jim fussell is in the process of ordering the pc ' s for this jv at my\nrequest . i will need the work order numbers to track these costs .\nnetworks : i ' m coordinating with arshak and his team to make sure that the\nvoice and data networks are in place for eb 21 . once the more permanent spot\nis nailed down we will then need to do the same for that location . a\ncombination of trader phones , lucent phones , stenfons and amtels have been\nrequested .\nlocation on eb 21 : i ' m waiting on a call back from chris larson from\nfacilities to find out what locations on 21 will be assigned to the new jv .\ncurrently half of the floor is empty but they are set up with high wall\ncubes . there may need to be some build out for the traders to low wall\ncubes . we can ' t set up the pc ' s , phones , amtels , etc until this is done .\ndata conversion : i have requested from texaco the contract , deal and\nmeter / facility information we will need to set up in our systems to begin\ntrading for march production . it may be possible to get an electronic dump\nof this data from texaco if enron defines the data fields that we will need .\nwe also need to set up the trading entities and portfolios . i will also need\nto know who will need to have access to this data so that we can set up the\nsystem security . i have received the names of the traders but i don ' t know\nwho else will need access .\ninterface between enron ' s unify pop ' s application and bridgeline ' s scada\napplication : i ' ve asked dave nommensen from enron to get with carryn wright\nfrom texaco to begin the process of defining the interface between the two\napplications and estimate the time to build and implement the interface .\nthere will also need to be a transition plan put in place where lrc ' s\nrtu ' s / efm is redirected to the bridgeline scada system . in the meantime\nthere will be two scada systems and perhaps two gas controls until everything\nis merged into one . this will probably mean some manual interfaces between\npop ' s and scada for confirmed noms and efm volumes until the transition is\ncomplete .\nscada communications : currently the lrc rtu ' s / efm communicate back to\nenron ' s scada system via leased lines . bridgelines rtu ' s communicate back to\nthem via a microwave system . the new jv could save on communications costs\nby switching lrc ' s rtu communication to the microwave . perhaps this is best\ndone as a part of the scada transition .\naccounting data needed by texaco for royalty purposes :

"\nover 3 , 600 people visited the site the first day , and daily prizes were\nawarded for the first two weeks . the " island trading post " will open again\nsoon , offering a complete line of tropical items , not just to those of us\nthat live a few blocks from wal - mart , but also for those of us lucky enough\nto be on a sailboat or living on an island . for not , we \' ll start with the\n" t - shirt of the month . "\nwe want " the expatriate zone " to not only keep you entertained and informed\nwhile you toil away at your everyday " corporate gig , " but it will also get\nyou ready for that day you finally shuck it all and disappear down into " the\nexpatriate zone . "\nwe hope you all enjoy our new effort , and also continue to visit " parrot key "\nand " club st . somewhere . " both of which will be closely associated with " the\nexpatriate zone " and " parrotkey . com . "\njackson & bob\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n" expatriate of the month "\njames " sunny jim " white\nwhen i first ventured on the internet in 1995 , i ran in to a guy named " sunny\njim " who was living down in the cayman islands . we never really got a chance\nto connect , for which i am truly sorry . but , when something is supposed to\nhappen , it usually does .\non the first leg of my " road dawg " tour\n( click on " road dawg " ) i stayed with my good friend alex & janet leist and\ntheir wonderful children . over the five days i stayed at their house , alex\nand i listened to a lot of music , and one of the guys we both liked was\n" sunny jim . " i bought one of james \' cds from alex , and fell in love with it\nimmediately . the cd was his second , called " life in the laid back lane . "\nlittle did i know that i would meet up with james and his roady " shady floyd "\nseveral times over the next six months . james was embarking on his first real\ntour of the us since he moved " down island " almost twelve years ago . we got\nseveral chances to talk over the summer , and we will have an in depth article\nabout this " expatriate " soon on " the expatriate zone " web site . be sure to\nwatch for it .\nin the meantime , here are a couple of quick things i learned about this great\nmusician . when i asked him about his " expatriate " status , his reply was ,\n" technically , an expatriate is someone who lives outside their own country ,\nfor whatever reason . for some it \' s legal reasons , others just because they\nwant to , or that \' s where the work is . i have been an expatriate for nearly\ntwelve years now . i have pretty fully lived the whole caribbean experience ,\nfrom climbing the coconut trees and spear fishing , to sailing , scuba diving ,\nhot afternoons on the beach and romantic moonlit nights under the swaying\npalms . "\neven as james is about to repatriate himself and his family , i ask if there\nwere any other places he would consider living as an expatriate ? " maybe\nsomewhere on the coast of mexico or in a group of islands that are all within\nsailing distance of one another , " was the advice he gave .\nuntil we can learn more of " sunny jim \' s " world , stop by his web site at\nand if you don \' t have one of his cds , including his\nlatest release " sandbar serenade , " for goodness sake , pick one up . you can\nalso read a great interview alex conducted with james at\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\ntravel into " the zone "\n" some are running from the irs "\nwe strongly believe that we all have to get away from our computer screens\nand out into the real world as often as we can . does this mean we give up one\nour most useful tools of communication , computers ? heck no ! with laptops ,\ncell phones and gps systems , we can go anywhere , and still stay in touch if\nwe feel the need . but get real and throw that " pager " away as soon as you can .\nwe hope to keep this section current and informative , hopefully hearing from\nthose of you already living your lives in " the zone , " helping the rest of us\nprepare for our getaway from the cities . i \' m sure there are some of us that\nare preparing to " disappear " to places like costa rica , where the " the\nexpatriate zone " will become an important tool .\nhow would you like to check out a place to " disappear " to and write it off\nyour taxes at the same time ? want to go down into " the zone " to places like\nthe bahamas , belize , st . croix , puerto rico , bonaire , the dominica republic\nor saba ? want to do something for the planet , work with dolphins , save a\ncoral reef , or study monkeys and the rain forest at the same time ?\nwell we have the answer . check out these organization \' s web sites , and then\nget some advice from your financial advisor on 501 c non - profit organizations .\ndepending on the tax bracket you \' re in , uncle sam could end up paying for up\nto half the trip .\nthe oceanic society\nearthwatch institute\nreef , the reef environmental education foundation\nafter that , all that \' s left is to make that plane reservation , and remember ,\n" no plane on sunday . "\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n" jimmydotcom "\nafter many delays , " jimmydotcom " has finally gone to the printer with a due\ndate of the middle of april . i hit some " bumps in the road " on my way to\npublishing the first ever book about the parrot head phenomena , but it was\nall worth it .\nthis book isn \' t about jimmy buffett , it \' s about the effect of the internet on\nparrot heads . for more information , visit . we\nhave a complete outline of the book , reviews from other parrot heads , and\nsamples of the pages on the site .\nfinancial considerations have limited the first printing to 1 , 000 copies at\nthe present time , so if your even thinking of buying a book , i suggest you\nreserve your copy by putting your name on the " reservation list . " you will be\nunder no financial obligation . it will simply indicate to my financial\npartners ( who aren \' t parrot heads ) , just how many books we need to print . do\nit right away , because pre - sales were brisk , and if enough of you reserve a\ncopy , i can get the financing to expand the first printing .\nlet \' s show the world what parrot heads stand for by making this book a big\nsuccess . when i was on the bhotm tour this summer , i had many people tell me\nthey wanted to buy an extra book to give to their boss . they wanted the boss\nto understand why getting the day off for a buffett concert is so important .\nmaybe it will help the rest of us to explain ourselves to our friends " that\njust don \' t get it . "\nhere \' s one of the latest reviews of the book from bob robinson , founder &\npresident of the sandlapper phc in south carolina . i had a great time with\nthis club on the " road dawg " tour , and shared an advance copy with his club :\n" when we received jackson \' s plea for pictures , our members were blown away .\nwe hustled up a package of pix , as did a majority of the parrot head clubs\nfrom around the globe , and the result is pure parrothedonistic pleasure . this\ncollection is bound for glory in the annals of island time . if moderation is\nyour key to life then stay away from jimmydotcom , \' cause this book is packed\nwith those stories only we can tell . congratulations bubbafreak ! "\nbobrob sandlapper phc\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nclub trini update\nspeaking of expatriates , how about the guys who play the true music of " the\nzone ? " club trini \' s long awaited live cd will finally be coming out this\napril , one year after it \' s recording . jimmy has been keeping mike and robert\npretty busy , so it \' s understandable that it took awhile . it will be the third\nin the " margaritaville cafe - late nite " series . i can \' t wait to hear it , as\nmy wife and i were some of the lucky ones who were in new orleans when it was\nrecorded .\nyou can get a look at all the songs included on the new cd at club trini \' s\nrevamped web site at . along with the great songs we \' ve\nbecome accustomed to , are a few i \' m pretty excited about . if you haven \' t\nheard ct \' s version of " african friend " you \' re in for a real treat . along with\nthat , is a song that tina and nadirah have been treating audiences to this\npast summer , " cario " and bob marley \' s " no woman , no cry . "\nat the new web site , fans can " now " order their favorite club trini cds using\ntheir credit cards . so there \' s no excuse to not owning everything available .\ni think a true " expatriate musical library " is incomplete without club trini .\nthis summer , helen hiatt , jimmy and the coral reefer \' s wardrobe designer ,\ncame up with a shirt that club trini members lovingly call the " ice cream\nvendor " shirt , which they wear out front at the start of the concert . ok ,\npete sometimes forgets his , and when he does have it on , it lost it \' s sleeves\nsomewhere along the way . there \' s a great design that has been applied to a\nt - shirt that we all can own . check it out at their site .\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\njesters and friends\nnote card series\ntro - pics has just released their first note cards\nseries from their " jesters and friends " original oils . friends , places and\nmusicians from past years have inspired these cards and parrot heads and\nexpatriates alike will want to have these great looking cards for those times\nwhen an email just isn \' t personal enough .\nthe original artwork is also on sale at this site , so be sure to stop by and\nvisit them . included in the " jesters " series are our good friends tim glancey\nand wally nickel .\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nmillennium change bubba style\ni \' ve got to tell you , i wasn \' t buying into this " new millennium " thing , one\nbit . in fact , i had almost decided not to go to the buffett new year \' s eve\nshow . nothing to do with jimmy , but i just didn \' t get the whole hype . but at\nthe last minute , i had a change of heart .\nand now after being a special guest at seagram \' s party honoring the new\nmargaritaville tequila , i \' m sure glad i went . the shows kind of melded\ntogether for me , making the millennium change over very special .\nif you want to hear more about this or see some pictures of both , visit our\nnew " the expatriate zone " web site at and go to\nthe web version of this newsletter .\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nflash ! ! !

"\n( emphasis added . )\nfurther , support for relying on marginal rather than average costs comes from\nthe commission itself . in its order of march 30 , 1979 setting this cause for\nhearing , mimeo at 4 , 5 , the commission , in commenting on time of day and\nseasonal rates , mentioned that it encourage innovative rate design to match\nmore closely rates to costs . in this regard , the commission cited its order\nno . 537 , supra at 4 , which specifically suggests use of pricing mechanisms\nbased on marginal cost principles\n[ 65 , 236 ]\nfor jurisdictional wholesale sales . under the circumstances in this case ,\nwhere the sale of economy energy is related to edison \' s costs in adding or\neliminating additional excess capacity , it is appropriate to establish the\nprice for economy transactions on marginal costs . this provides a more close\nmatching of the rate to the cost than would a rate design based on average\ncosts . accordingly , winnetka \' s position on pricing of economy energy will not\nbe adopted .\naffirmed and reversed - see next paragraph\ncomm - opinion - order , 23 ferc ?

( i simply add a piece of masking tape since it \' s easy to\nsee . ) then when routing the gauge ( and later , the panel ) , always keep\nthis mark against the straightedge . your dadoes should be right on .\nanother email came in from mike , who suggested making two alignment\ngauges . then you can clamp one at each end of the workpiece before you\nclamp the straightedge fence down . this prevents the " wiggling " that\noften occurs when one end is clamped before the other . great tip !\na big thanks to all who have been sending in suggestions . it \' s great to\nhear that so many people are enjoying the tips .\ntalk to you again in a few weeks .\njon garbison\non - line editor\nwoodsmith\nvisit our other woodworking and home improvement sites :\n100 + woodworking plans :\nwoodsmith magazine :\nshopnotes magazine :\nworkbench magazine :\nkits , jigs , tools , project plans :\nback issues :\nwoodworking forums :\nto change your email address or resubscribe , sign up again at\nto unsubscribe , send empty email message to :\nnote : your subscribed email address is\n',
